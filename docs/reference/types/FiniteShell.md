```

The `FiniteShell` struct stores general information about a window.

## Notes

1) wl_output is a pointer but not an array. The Islands compositor only allows one output at a time which is reflected in this value.<br>
2) Snapshots are able to be recovered to return the UI to a previous state. They currently do not apply array related changes to buttons.<br>

## Standard Usage
When creating an appplication in libfinite you must **always** use a FiniteShell object created with `finite_shell_init`. Unless you need a specific wayland client, "wayland-0" should be the parameter passed into `finite_shell_init`.

The Cubix Infinite uses Wayland as it's display server so in order to keep the FiniteShell session alive you'll need to use use the wayland function [`wl_display_dispatch`](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/docs/html/apb.html#Client-classwl__display_1a30a9c4f020f3e77581c7a81ecdb4913d) for cairo based applications or [`wl_display_dispatch_pending`](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/docs/html/apb.html#Client-classwl__display_1ac4b6b5ad31932bc3830ff362d2938560) for Vulkan based applications.

When creating an application in libfinite you'll need to call either `finite_window_init` or `finite_overlay_init` depending on what you're creating. For more information, see their corresponding pages.
